1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was for the scenario for Chada Tech who has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.  This was heloping to solve their issue and give them a program they can accomplish this with.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I created a well-versed code for this project with proper notes throughout the code to explain how it is supposed to work.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I am still having trouble making the 24-hour clock work, so by figuring this out I could enhance this code to work like it was intended to work.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I feel like the whole project was difficult as I am new to C++ and really all programming languages.  I had to do a lot of extra research to help me to understand what I needed to write and how it worked to get what I have written to work the way it is.  Having the knowledge of Python and Java, made it both easier and more difficult as I got confused between the languages very easily, but still helped as it was similar enough to figure out how I needed to write it in C++ by using other languageâ€™s code.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I feel like knowing the code and how it works will help me in the future with not only C++ but also other programming languages I will learn to use.  By wanting to go into Ethical Hacking I feel like this knowledge of all programming languages will help me to be a better hacker in the future to help multiple clients and companies to better themselves against malicious hacking. 

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this code maintainable, readable and adaptable by being able to add more lines of code to incorporate future changes to this program, making it easier to understand so when needing to change something in the future the lines needing the change can be found easily, and also by leaving detailed notes throughout the code I can figure out what lines of code are doing what so I can change them to make it more adaptable for future change.
